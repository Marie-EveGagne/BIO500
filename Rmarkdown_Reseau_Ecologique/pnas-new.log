I wasn't able to read the size data for this font,
so I will ignore the font specification.
[Wizards can fix TFM files using TFtoPL/PLtoTF.]
You might try inserting a different font spec;
e.g., type `I\font<same font id>=<substitute font name>'.

! Extra \else.

I'm ignoring this; it doesn't match any \if.

misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct

A one-character control sequence belongs after a ` mark.
So I'm essentially inserting \0 here.
